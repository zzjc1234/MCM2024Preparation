# Overview

**mathematical model**: a representation in mathematical terms of the behavior of real devices and objects

## Modelling Process

### Outline

1. Clearly **state** the problem
2. Identify **variables and parameters**
3. Make **assumptions** and identify **constraints**
4. Build **solutions**
5. **Analyze and assess**
6. Report the **results**

### Details

- **Problem Statement**

  - Modeling problems are _open-ended_
  - Challenging to know _where to start_
  - Clearly state the problem to define the objective

- **Variables and Parameters**

  - variables
    - Independent variables: _input_
    - Dependent variables: _predicted output_
    - Identify variables from a clear problem statement
  - Parameters: quantities that appear in the relationships between variables
  - List all variables and parameters in the system
    - give them names and symbols
    - identify their _dimensions_

- **Assumptions and Constraints**

  - Assumptions
    - _reduce model complexity_
    - Define relationships between variables
  - Constraints describe allowed values

- **Build Solutions**

  - Clear problem statement and lists
  - Decide _mathematical tools_ for the model
  - _Determine_ if the model is deterministic, stochastic, or data-driven
    - ==how?==
  - Apply chosen tools to construct the model

- **Analyze and Assess**

  - Finding a solution doesn't guarantee meaningful results
  - _Interpret the solution_ in the context of the problem
  - Ask questions about the solution
    - Does the solution make sense in the _context_ of the problem?
    - Does the solution _answer our problem statement_?
    - Are the results obtained _reasonable and practical_?
  - Critical analysis in case of _discrepancies or errors_

- **Report Results**
  - Share results through a clear and concise report
  - Document the model and its implementation

## Types of different models

- **Deterministic Models**

  - Predict the future based on current information
  - Do not include randomness
  - Often formulated as _systems of differential equations_
    - Describe system evolution over time

- **Stochastic Models**

  - Include randomness
  - Based on _probability distributions and stochastic processes_

- **Data-Driven Models**
  - Look for patterns in observed data
  - Predict system output based on data
  - Often formulated as _functions with parameters fitted to observed data_
