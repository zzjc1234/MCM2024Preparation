# Deterministic Models

## Overview

- **deterministic**: always produces the same output for the same initial conditions
- Often formulated as _systems of differential equations_
  - applying **physical laws** to get the functions
  - applying the **nondimensionalization** procedure
    - scale the model variables to simply the model
    - provide insight into the systemâ€™s behavior in terms of the parameters
  - solving:
    - analytically solvable (if lucky), use mathematica etc.
    - approximate with _numerical methods_, use **Scipy** etc.

- How to use `scipy` to solve IVP
  1. Judge whether one dimension, first order
  2. For higher order problem, convert to multi-dimension problem
  3. Solve one dimension problem or multi-dimension problem
  4. Plot the result

### Nondimensionalization

- **dimension** of a [physical quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Quantities) refers to its expression in terms of the _base quantities_, such as time, length, mass and temperature.
- An equation is **dimensionally homogeneous** if the expressions on both sides of the equation have the same dimensions.
- **Nondimensionalization**: scaling variables to simplify the model and identify the key properties in terms of _dimensionless parameters_.
