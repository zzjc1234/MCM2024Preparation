# Overview
**mathematical model**: a representation in mathematical terms of the behavior of real devices and objects

## Modelling Process

### Outline
1. Clearly **state** the problem
2. Identify **variables and parameters**
3. Make **assumptions** and identify **constraints**
4. Build **solutions**
5. **Analyze and assess**
6. Report the **results**

### Details
- **Problem Statement**
  - Modelling problems are *open-ended*
  - Challenge to know *where to start*
  - Clearly state the problem to define the objective

- **Variables and Parameters**
  - variables
    - Independent variables: *input*
    - Dependent variables: *predicted output*
    - Identify variables from a clear problem statement
  - Parameters: quantities that appear in the relationships between variables
  - List all variables and parameters in the system
    - give them names and symbols
    - identify ther *dimensions*

- **Assumptions and Constraints**
  - Assumptions
    - *reduce model complexity*
    - Define relationships between variables
  - Constraints describe allowed values

- **Build Solutions**
  - Clear problem statement and lists
  - Decide *mathematical tools* for the model
  - *Determine* if the model is deterministic, stochastic, or data-driven
    - ==how?==
  - Apply chosen tools to construct the model

- **Analyze and Assess**
  - Finding a solution doesn't guarantee meaningful results
  - *Interpret the solution* in the context of the problem
  - Ask questions about the solution
    - Does the solution make sense in the *context* of the problem?
    - Does the solution *answer our problem statement*?
    - Are the results obtained *reasonable and practical*?
  - Critical analysis in case of *discrepancies or errors*

- **Report Results**
  - Share results through a clear and concise report
  - Document the model and its implementation


## Types of different models

- **Deterministic Models**
  - Predict future based on current information
  - Do not include randomness
  - Often formulated as *systems of differential equations*
    - Describe system evolution over time

- **Stochastic Models**
  - Include randomness
  - Based on *probability distributions and stochastic processes*

- **Data-Driven Models**
  - Look for patterns in observed data
  - Predict system output based on data
  - Often formulated as *functions with parameters fitted to observed data*
