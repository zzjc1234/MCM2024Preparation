# Modeling

## workflow
- restate and classify the problem
  - [deterministic models](Modeling/intro_math_model/deterministic_models.md)
  - [stochastic models](Modeling/intro_math_model/stochastic_models.md)
- evalute the missions and choice of models
  - predict
  - arrange/optimize
  - relativity
  - cluster/classify
  - conprehensive analysis
- search for and refer to similar examples
  - for different subjects and background
    - biology [\ref](Modeling/intersection/biology/materials.md)
- search for and evaluate data
- choice of practical methods and finding sample code
- reflect to and adjust the model according to the results
- analysis and evaluation of models (error etc)
- etc
